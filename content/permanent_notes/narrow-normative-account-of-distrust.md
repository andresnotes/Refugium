Agnosticism Trust/Distrust
[[undefined/narrow-normative-account-of-trust|Narrow Normative Account of Trust]]

To be agnostic about trust/distrust, in relation to an individual, group, or an institution, is to be unsure about whether she or it will act justly or not – it is a “wait and see” type of attitude. In such cases, one lacks positive reasons to trust or distrust.
