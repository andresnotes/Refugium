## Old - Trust as an Affective Attitude

>[! Abstract] Definition
> >Trust is an attitude of optimism that the goodwill and competence of another will extend to cover the domain of our interaction with her, together with the expectation that the one trusted will be directly and favorably moved by the thought that we are counting on her.

- Jones does not support this definition of trust anymore. She made some changes (see below)

## New - Trust, Distrust and Affective Looping

>[! Abstract] Definition
> >A trusts B in domain of interaction D, if and only if A has an attitude of optimism that Bâ€™s competence and responsiveness to her dependency will extend to cover that domain.

- compared to the old definition, the new definition does not feature **goodwill** or an **expectation**anymore
- instead she introduces **responsiveness** which seems rather vague.
