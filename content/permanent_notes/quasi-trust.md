>Trust in Government is not possible because

A claim to trust government is typically implausible if it is supposed to be analogous to a claim to trust another person.[...] The difficulty with ’trusting government’ is that the knowledge demanded by [...] trust is simply unavailable to ordinary citizens. (S.151)

In actual life we might often not trust an organization but might merely depend on its apparent pre- dictability by induction from its past behavior. Then we have merely an expectations account of the organization’s behavior. [...] [L]et us call this quasi trust.(S.156f.)
