>The antagonist of [[undefined/trust|Trust]].

- There seems to be a consensus in the literature that distrust is not merely the absence of trust, as this could also be a neutral position that is neither trust nor distrust. 
- In the literature, distrust is mentioned or conceptualised significantly less often than trust.
