> [! example] Classification
Seems to be a very distinct conception of trust compared to [[undefined/two-place-trust|Two-Place Trust]] and [[undefined/three-place-trust|Three-Place Trust]].

## Notes

- Very controversial concept.
- If there is no object of trust, what is the trust directed towards?
	- In "Finding Trust in Government" Faulkner claims that one can have a general attitude of trust towards people or the govenment. Wouldn't that make "people" or "the government" the object of trust, thus making it at leat [[undefined/two-place-trust|Two-Place Trust]]? Can groups of people not be seen as an object of two-place trust? Why not?
- One charitable way of reading it might be: If i have a an general attitude of trust, I will evaluate every entity that can be met with that attitude accordingly, i.e. through a "filter"of trust. That filter could mean I evaluate the situation in a certain way, see here: [[undefined/cognitive-set|Cognitive Set]].
