## Overview

>[! Abstract] Definition
> - A trusts B to Î¦. **or**
> - A trusts B in Domain D. (Jones)
> 

- Most analyzed type of trust in philosophical literature.
- This analysis of trust has the advantage of accommodating the intuition that we usually do not trust people in **every** situation and circumstance but rather just in specific situations or with individual actions.
- 


>[! Danger] Objection
> An analysis of trust as an exclusively three-place predicate cannot explain our intuition (although maybe contradictory to the intuition mentioned above) that we sometimes trust people not just in specific situations of circumstances but on a more *general* level and without much thought or evaluation of specific instances of this trust.
> #PaulFaulkner, #RichardHolton and #JacopoDomenicucci have contested the idea that three-three place trust is how we should generally understand trust. See:
> - #PaulFaulkner(2015): "The attitude of Trust is basic", *Analysis* Vol. 75 No. 3, pp. 424-429.
