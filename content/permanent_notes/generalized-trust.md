## Overview

>[! Abstract] Definition
> >To these two attitudes of trust must be added a third: a generalized attitude of trust—trust with no specific object, one-place trust. Since it involves no particular belief about the trusted, this generalized form demonstrates the belief that our reliant interactions are normatively structured— that there is a right, or trustworthy, thing to do—combined with the optimistic view that others can generally be relied on to do this right, or trustworthy, thing.

to make this plausible, consider [[undefined/culture-of-trust-sztompka-1998-|Culture of Trust, Sztompka (1998)]] (although it might be two place trust with the government or society as the object of trust)

> [! question] 
> Hatte generalized trust eher mit Sztompkas zweiter Form von Trust (”attitude of basic trustfulness deriving from socialization”) in Verbindung gebracht als mit der culture of trust. See [[undefined/one-place-trust|One-Place Trust]].
