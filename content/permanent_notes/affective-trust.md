## Overview

>[! Abstract] Definition: reliance & normative expectation about outcome
> >Second, there is trust that is the conjunction of reliance with a normative expectation of outcome, which can be grouped with two-place trust since both are grounded by the belief that one’s relation to the trusted is normatively structured. As such, I’ll refer to both as affective trust [...] to make it clear that trust is associated with the reactive attitudes — this is the kind of trust that can be betrayed — and let the context make clear whether it is two-place or three-place trust that is the concern.

- Normative expectation about outcome is also a feature of Jones' Definition [[undefined/trust-as-an-affective-attitude|Trust as an Affective Attitude]]
