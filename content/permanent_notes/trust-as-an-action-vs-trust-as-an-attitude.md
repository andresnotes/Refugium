## Notes

### Vertrauen als Handlung (act of trusting):

>[! Info]
>The act of trusting is one of putting oneself in a position of depending on something happening or someone doing something. [...] An act of trusting is thereby one of relying: in trusting we rely on something happening or someone doing something. But, and crucially, trust differs from reliance in that it is necessarily willingly. (S.627)

### Vertrauen als Einstellung (attitude of trust):


>[! Info]
>
>[...] an attitude towards this dependence, or reliance, that explains its willingness. (S.627)

**Dünne Einstellung (thin attitude)**  
The simplest attitude that could explain a willingness to rely would be belief. If X believed that Y would Φ, then X’s relying on Y Φ-ing would be unproblematic. And the attitude of trust can be no more than this: a positive belief about outcome. In so far as it is no more than belief, both persons and things can be trusted. (S.628)

**Dicke Einstellung (thick attitude)**  
[...] when X trusts Y to Φ, X’s attitude can be simply the belief that Y will Φ — the expectation characteristic of trust can be merely subjective — but X’s expectation can also be normative. [...] As I understand it, the content of this normative expectation is that the trusted party will take one’s reliance as a reason for doing what one relies on them doing [...] (S.629f.)
