### Trust & Reliance

It is helpful to distinguish [[undefined/trust|Trust]] from [[undefined/reliance|Reliance]]. There are differences that seem rather certain:
- One cannot trust inanimate objects (e.g. a car). However, one can rely on them.
	- Some say we can *predictively trust* inanimate objects to capture the fact that people do speak of trusting inanimate objects. This seems to me to be a mere verbal dispute.
- Trust is "stronger" than reliance in some way. While reliance is purely predictive, trust is more intimate / more personal (/ has more necessary conditions).
	- Hardin would say: Trust is (reliance +)(??) encapsulated interest.
	- Holton would say: Trust is reliance + participant stance (has to do with reactive attitudes).
	- Faulkner would say: (Affective) trust is reliance + normative expectation about outcome (similar to Holton).
	- Hawley would say: Trust is reliance + commitment (also has to do with reactive attitudes).
	- Baier would also say: Trust is reliance + something with reactive attitudes.
	- (Early) Jones would say: Trust is an affective attitude (of optimism that the other person has goodwill towards us) together with the expectation that the one trusted will be directly and favorably moved by the thought that we are counting on her.
		- While reliance is "simply" a propositional attitude (that someone will do a certain thing).
	- Budnik would say: Trust is inter*personal*, requires a personal relationship.
- No matter whether reactive attitudes are a part of the definition of trust or not, it seems that trust justifies reactive attitudes, while reliance does not. That is: I may feel betrayed by and blame someone that abuses my trust. But I may not feel betrayed by and blame my car when it breaks down -- rather, other negative attitudes are fitting here (e.g. disppointment, frustration(, anger?)).
- Reliance only exists as a three-place-relation. Trust maybe also exists as a two- and one-place-relation. When I say that I rely on my car, I always implicitly mean that I rely on it to do certain things (e.g. turn on).

### Trust as a One-/Two-/Three-Place Relation
*I transferred this section over to other notes.*

How many places does the trust-relation have? Maybe there are three distinct concepts of trust:
- [[undefined/one-place-trust|One-Place Trust]]. This could e.g. be understood as a disposition to trust or as the (optimistic) belief that others are generally trustworthy.
	- Sztompka calls this "'basic trustfulness' deriving from socialization" (1998, 19).
	- Faulkner calls this "a generalized attitude of trust" (2018, 630).
- [[undefined/two-place-trust|Two-Place Trust]]. A trusts B. Something like: Trusting someone *as a person* (cf. Domenicucci & Holton).
	- Intuitive as many people would probably say that they *generally* trust their partners and close friends.
	- Domenicucci & Holton list some linguistic data that suggests that two-place-trust is more central than three-place-trust.
- [[undefined/three-place-trust|Three-Place Trust]]. The third place could be an action (A trusts B to do C) or a domain (A trusts B in domain C).
	- Dominant conception in the literature. 
	- Especially plausible when one thinks that trust is linked to competence, as people are competent in domains rather than generally competent.
	- Also plausible in that there may be domains in which we don't trust people even though we trust them in most domains (see below).

It is, however, also possible that two-place-trust is always implicitly three-place. That is: Saying that *A trusts B* is the same as saying something like *A trusts B in the (sufficiently large) set C of {domain 1, domain 2, ...}*. 
- Something that possibly supports this idea: I may trust my good friend who is a newly recovering alcoholic in nearly all domains, but not around bars and alcohol and such. And this talk of exception is best analysable when you treat trust as a three-place-relation. 
- If one has a two-place-trust that can deal with this, then, to be honest, I am not entirely sure what really depends on this two-place vs. three-place discussion. But it is useful to split off one-place-trust as a distinct kind of thing.
	- two- and three-place trust metaphysically the same thing, but may be salient in different contexts (psychologically)

Sztompka's [[undefined/culture-of-trust-sztompka-1998-|culture of trust]] seems to be orthogonal to this discussion. It could be understood either as:
- How much the culture enables & encourages people to enter into two-/three-place-relations of trust.
- And/or how much the culture enables & encourages people to be disposed to trust (one-place).
	
 (- goes via one-place (directly influences) into two-/three place (indirectly influences)?)

(could also have a distinct notion of two-place-trust: disposition to trust person X (closer to one-place trust))

### Trust & Distrust

There is not only trust, but also:
- [[undefined/distrust|Distrust]]
- Mere absence of trust (a neutral position) ([[undefined/agnosticism-towards-trust-or-distrust|Agnosticism towards Trust or Distrust]])

Discussing distrust might shine light on the trust debate. A relevant question is whether trust and distrust are symmetric or asymmetric. There are, of course, many different accounts of distrust:
- Krishnamurthy: "Distrust is the confident belief that another individual or group of individuals or an institution will not act justly or as justice requires." (forthcoming, 1)
	- This is a very narrow account of distrust (relating to just acts) and it is not clear how to expand it. That is, it is not clear how to spell out X in 'distrust is the confident belief that X'. All in all, this account is not all that useful.
- Hawley (who seems to think that trust and distrust are symmetric): 
	- "Roughly speaking, to trust someone is to rely upon that person to fulfil a commitment, whilst distrust involves an expectation of unfulfilled commitment." (2014, 1)
	- "Distrusting someone with respect to X involves not relying upon her to X, rather than relying upon her not to X: distrust does not require confident prediction of misbehaviour." (2014, 4)
- (Early) Jones might say something like: An attitude of pessimism: That the other person has illwill towards us?

### Trust & Politics

See also [[undefined/trust-in-politics-and-government|Trust in Politics and Government]]

A relevant distinction for trust in the context of politics is the distinction between:
- Horizontal trust: Trust between citizens.
- Vertical trust: Trust between citizens and the government / government representatives.

And the main questions in the debate are about vertical trust, namely:
1. Is trust in government (representatives) *possible*?
2. Can trust in government (representatives) be *justified*?

Budnik (& Hardin) argue that trust in government (representatives) is not even *possible* because an interpersonal relationship is needed and one (usually) does not have such a relationship. Faulkner similarly argues that it is not possible to affectively trust government.
- However, many people feel like they trust certain politicians / report that they trust certain politicians. Budnik/Hardin are commited to saying that they are all mistaken.
	- Hardin's explanation: We 'quasi-trust' government (representatives). That is, we rely on them and we confuse this reliance with trust.
	- Faulkner's explanation: We predictively trust (i.e. rely). Additionally, the government / government representatives can be included in our generalized trust (if put another way, generalized trust is at danger of becoming a two-place-relation?). 
	- Another explanation for this error theory (not from literature): Parasocial relationships can *feel* real. So people still *feel* like they trust certain politicians, even though they don't.

Other accounts can grant that it is possible, albeit often not *justified*. Take accounts working with participant stance and reactive attitudes -- it is possible to take a participant stance towards government representatives as they are people. But it might be unjustified in various ways: 
- We lack information about them (when entering the participant stance).
	- What about local politics -- exception?
- Trust is personal, in a way, and politics should not be personal (but rather: fair? effective?). Personal politics sounds like corruption.
- If parasocial relatonships can be the basis of trust, then the trust generated through parasocial relationships might still not be justified.

Thoughts on these questions: The claim that trust in government (representative) is not even *possible* is rather strong. The claim that it is usually not justified is, prima facie, more plausible. Something to support this intuition is the fact that there is a difference between government representatives and inanimate objects. Also, an error theory plausibly has a higher burden of proof because it has to explain why all these people are mistaken in their perception of who they trust.

A takeaway is that reliance is more important than trust when it comes to politics, and that mechanisms to increase reliance should be implemented. Such mechanisms include separation of powers, a party system where different parties surveil each other and sound the alarm if something goes wrong, free media with investigative journalists that sound the alarm if something goes wrong, transparency that enables experts to sound the alarm if something goes wrong, etc (see Sztompka, Hardin, Budnik, but also Thomas Christiano (2015?) on democracy & shortcuts).  

Question: Is it debated whether distrust in government (representatives) can be possible/justified?


A possibly important point to end: Trust and reliance are both plausibly gradual. I can trust and rely more or less. Some confusion about what counts as trust might be explained via weak degrees of trust. E.g. trusting the car mechanic I go to every year -- mostly reliance, but possibly also weak trust? But maybe this also applies to politicians.
