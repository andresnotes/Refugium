## Overview

>[! Abstract] Definition: reliance & belief about outcome
> >First, there is trust that is the conjunction of reliance with a belief about outcome. Given that we can “trust” in this way without having any positive view of the “trusted” party’s motivations—for example, I might trust you to pay me because I know you fear the consequences of not doing so — I’ll call this predictive trust to make clear that trust is little more than a prediction about outcome.

- similar to [[undefined/trust-as-encapsulated-interest|Trust as Encapsulated Interest]] in that it is only a belief (not as expectation like in [[undefined/affective-trust|Affective Trust]])
