>[! Warning] Disclaimer
>I borrow these definitions form Paul Faulkner. Other authors may make a similar but slightly different discrimination. This may lead to substantially differing outcomes. However, these definitions show major differences between these two attitudes and capture the general idea well

## Thin Attitude

>[! Info] Definition
>The simplest attitude that could explain a willingness to rely would be belief. If X believed that Y would Φ, then X’s relying on Y Φ-ing would be unproblematic. And the attitude of trust can be no more than this: a positive belief about outcome. In so far as it is no more than belief, both persons and things can be trusted. (S.628)

## Thick Attitude

>[! Info]
>[...] when X trusts Y to Φ, X’s attitude can be simply the belief that Y will Φ — the expectation characteristic of trust can be merely subjective — but X’s expectation can also be normative. [...] As I understand it, the content of this normative expectation is that the trusted party will take one’s reliance as a reason for doing what one relies on them doing [...] (S.629f.)
