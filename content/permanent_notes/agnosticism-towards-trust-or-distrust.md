## Overview

>[! Abstract] In a Nutshell
> > "To be agnostic about trust/distrust, in relation to an individual, group, or an institution, is to be unsure about whether she or it will act justly or not – it is a “wait and see” type of attitude. In such cases, one lacks positive reasons to trust or distrust." (p. 8)

- There seems to be a consensus in the literature on trust and distrust that the negation of trust is not distrust and the negation of distrust ist not trust.
- Krishnamurthy gives an account of this which relates to her [[undefined/narrow-normative-account-of-trust|Narrow Normative Account of Trust]] and her [[undefined/narrow-normative-account-of-distrust|Narrow Normative Account of Distrust]]
