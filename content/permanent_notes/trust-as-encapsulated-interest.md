## Overview

>[! Abstract] Encapsulated Interest
> >To say that I trust you in some context simply means that I think you will be trustworthy toward me in that context.
>
>>I trust you because I think it is in your interest to take my interests in the relevant matter seriously in the following sense: You value the continuation of our relationship, and you therefore have your own interests in taking my interests into account. That is, you encapsulate my interests in your own interests.

- Trust simply means that A thinks B will be [[undefined/trustworthiness|trustworthy]].
- Encapsulated Interest is not the only way to be trustworthy. Hardin hardly talks about another one in his book though...
