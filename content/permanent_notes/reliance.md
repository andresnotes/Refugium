## Overview

>[! Abstract] X
> >

- In our everyday language we either
	- often use the word ''[[undefined/trust|Trust]]'' when we want to refer to reliance (narrow trust definition) or
	- the concept of trust is very wide and hence has a significant overlap with reliance/cannot be clearly distinguished from it.
- If we want to follow the narrow definition of trust, concepts such as [[undefined/trust-as-encapsulated-interest|Trust as Encapsulated Interest]]or [[undefined/predictive-trust|Predictive Trust]]may better describe a kind of reliance rather than trust.

"to rely on someone to X is to act on the supposition that she will X: this can fall short of believing that she will X, though it is incompatible with outright belief that she will not X" ((Hawley 2012, 4) summarizing (Holton 1994))
- justification not purely epistemic
- unlike believing sometimes a matter of choice
- does not need to involve risk or vulnerability
