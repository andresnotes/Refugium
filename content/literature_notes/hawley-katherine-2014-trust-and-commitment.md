## Notes

>[! Tip] Key Takeaways
>- Aims of Halweys Account:
>	- provide a unified account of both trust and distrust
>	- incopropate commitment into the account, because ...
>- "Roughly speaking, to trust someone is to rely upon that person to fulfil a commitment, whilst distrust involves an expectation of unfulfilled commitment." (p. 1)


>[! Info] Hawley's Definition of Trust and Distrust 
>To trust someone to do something is to believe that she has a commitment to doing it, and to rely upon her to meet that commitment. To distrust someone to do something is to believe that she has a commitment to doing it, and yet not rely upon her to meet that commitment. (p. 10)

### Assumptions  (p. 1)


>1. **Trust is primarily a three-place relation.** two people + task
>   (common assumption, see [[undefined/three-place-trust|Three-Place Trust]];   for a counter-position see[[undefined/two-place-trust|Two-Place Trust]])

>2. **Trust involves assumptions about both competence and willingness**

### Why Trust is not mere Reliance

>Trust is a significant category for normative assessment. Reliance is not. (p.2, bottom)

- Oftentimes, philosophers distinguish between trust and reliance. One can rely on inanimate objects without trusting them. One can rely on people without trusting them. 
- Trust can be betrayed: "[...]" there is a distinction between trust in a rich sense—trust which can be betrayed—and mere reliance. (p. 2)
- Distinguishing trust form reliance clashed with ordinary language use. Some philosophers (e.g. #PaulFaulkner) distinguish between predictive and affective (or normative) trust. Hawley sticks to trust vs. mere reliance while acknowledging that 'trust' can be used with instances of mere reliance.
	- Why is this disctinction important then, if we do not make it in ordinary language?
	- Because trust is relevant for normative assessment, reliance is not. Only trust is conncecnted to betrayal. Reliance is merely predictability.

### Why Distrust is not mere Nonreliance

> We react differently to misplaced distrust than to misplaced nonreliance. Distrust is richer than nonreliance.

- "Like trust, distrust has a normative dimension." (p. 3)
- reaction to misplaced distrust: remorse, apology, requests for forgiveness
- reaction to misplaces nonreliance: maybe regret for missed opportunities, nothing more
- Champagne example:
	- "My colleagues have never bought me champagne, so in particular I do not rely upon them to buy me champagne next Friday. But it would be wrong, even offensive, to say that I distrust my colleagues in this respect—after all, they have not offered to buy me champagne next Friday, and there is no social convention that they do so. If they did buy me champagne unexpectedly, I ought to be grateful, but I need not feel remorse about my earlier decision not to rely on them. Indeed, it would be bad manners for me to suggest in retrospect that I should have trusted my colleagues to buy me champagne, or to apologise for my earlier non-trust."
- "So distrust is richer than mere nonreliance, just as trust is richer than reliance. Just as we should distinguish trustworthiness from mere reliability, we should distinguish untrustworthiness from mere unreliability" (p. 3)

### Reliance and Nonreliance

> reliance like Holton; nonreliance lack of positive assumption rather than negative assumption

- Reliance (comp [[assets/03-handout-holton-1994-participant-stance-3a2c981fb803b7ffb0022519d20701b8.pdf|03_Handout_Holton_1994_Participant_Stance.pdf]]): "to rely on someone to X is to act on the supposition that she will X: this can fall short of believing that she will X, though it is incompatible with outright belief that she will not X." (p. 4)
	- justification not purely epistemic; unlike believing sometimes a matter of choice
	- does not need to involve risk or vulnerability
- "Distrusting someone with respect to X involves not relying upon her to X, rather than relying upon her not to X: distrust does not require confident prediction of misbehaviour." (p. 4)
	- no negative assumption needed for distrust, just lack of positive assumption --> nonreliance is enough


### Motives-Based Accounts of Trust Fail to Explain Distrust

> They provide neither necessary nor sufficient criteria for distrust

- often trust is reliance + X
- Hawley looks at Jones and Hardin
	- Jones: goodwill of the other
	- Hardin: ecapsulated interest + continuation of relationship
- Distrust should then be nonreliance + X
	- Jones: ill will
	- Hardin: frustrating my interest (+ not wanting to continue relationship)
- But there are cases that satisfy the nonreliance + x criterion but are not distrust
	- not necessary: "After all, someone who lies and cheats to achieve her goals should be distrusted, even if she does not bother to bear either goodwill or ill will to others, and does not care about other people’s interests." (p. 6)
	- not sufficient: "Suppose that a deeply honourable person campaigns to have me imprisoned for my crimes. I cannot rely on this person to help me, moreover I know that she bears me ill-will and is actively trying to frustrate my goals. But my attitude to her needn’t amount to distrust, for she is straightforward and honest in her campaigning. (This doesn’t mean that I should trust her; merely that I do not have grounds to distrust her.) Recall the connections between distrust, untrustworthiness, and remorse. My opponent does not display untrustworthiness in her open campaigning against me. And if she turns out to be more helpful than I had expected, I need not feel remorse about my previous attitude of nonreliance." (p. 6)
		- as this example fulfils Hawley's assumption of what Hardin and Jones would say about distrust and we still do not want to speak of distrust in this situation

###  Other Accounts of Trust are Incomplete

- Taking a Participant Stance is necessary for Distrust.
- "Flawed though they are, the motives-based accounts of trust do provide an account of what it is that the truster attributes to the trustee (e.g. goodwill). This permits investigation of the correctness conditions for trust: what is it about someone which makes it appropriate to trust her? The Holton and later Jones accounts, in contrast, tell us more about the truster’s attitudes than they do about the features of the trustee to which those attitudes are directed." (S. 9)

I did not really understand Hawley's argument in this section...


### The Commitment Account


>[! Info] Hawley's Definition of Trust and Distrust 
>To trust someone to do something is to believe that she has a commitment to doing it, and to rely upon her to meet that commitment. To distrust someone to do something is to believe that she has a commitment to doing it, and yet not rely upon her to meet that commitment. (p. 10)

- Commitment:
	- "In the relevant sense, one can be committed to doing something one has no intention of doing: if I’ve promised to come to your birthday party, but I now decide I can’t be bothered, I still have a commitment in the relevant sense, even though I have no intention of fulfilling it. Promising is one clear way of acquiring the relevant sort of commitment, though explicit promising is not the only route to commitment." (p. 10)
	- "To make the account plausible I must use a very broad notion of commitment: commitments can be implicit or explicit, weighty or trivial, conferred by roles and external circumstances, default or acquired, welcome or unwelcome. In particular I will take it that mutual expectation and convention give rise to commitment unless we take steps to disown these. And in section 8 I will argue that assertion involves commitment, so that trusting someone’s word falls within the scope of the account." (p. 11)
	- commitment to somebody (not necessarily to me or to Person A)

### Being Trusted, Being Distrusted

>commitment can help to understand the appropriateness of trust or distrust and (un)trsutworthiness

- "an effective theory of trust, distrust, trust- worthiness and untrustworthiness must explain what makes it reasonable to have (dis)trust-relevant normative expectations of others" (p. 12)
- violated trust can cause damage beyod misplaced reliance (e.g. emotional damage), but that is not what Hawley focuses on
- Trust is not necessary for betrayal as one can be betrayed by someone they distrust (expected betrayal)
