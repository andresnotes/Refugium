## Notes

 With inanimate objects what we colloquially refer to as [[undefined/trust|Trust]] can be reduced to reliance (e.g. on a chair). Humans are not generally disappointed by or feel betrayed by inanimate objects. It is not actually trust.
- Trust is closely linked to trustworthiness
- When humans trust other humans (interpersonal trust) they
	- rely on them (_Is that always the case though?)_
	-  economists and social scientists: assume what they trust people with aligns with their own rational self interest
	- Philosophers: belief the people they trust are good natured and caring towards you
	- Evolutionary psychologists: think these people will not let them down (reciprocal altruism)

- People tend to differentiate between trust in someone’s **intentions** and trust in someone’s **capabilities**. “For full trust, both of these are required”(6)
- Trust in deeds vs. trust in words
- Trusting people to speak the truth is very important _for social epistemology_. In order for someone to be trusted to say the truth, both trust in their Knowledge and their **honesty** is required.
-  But **Sincerity** seems not to be enough to be trustworthy (_especially important with politicians)_  as in many cases what you believe needs to be backed up by sufficient Evidence especially when the stakes are high.

### Hawley’s commitment criterion
>“When we trust people, we rely upon them to meet their commitments” (6) (the reasons why someone meets their commitment towards you can vary and thus align with the above mentioned ideas)
