## Notes

>[! Attention] Disclaimer
>This is only one small fraction of the argument after having read the text once rather superficially

- When considering group testimony, it does not add much to a persons epistemic position to consider groups to be trustworthy
- instead the epistemic evaluation (she also speaks about ethical considerations) of the group might best be done in terms of reliance
- comp #JonLeefmann paper on Justification of testimony of scientific experts and Assurance View
- because the entire group cannot be made responsible for the truth of testimony a group provides in one way or the other, and because no spokesperson of that group takes responsiility (in the sense of the assurance view) for what they say as a spokesperson of the group, the assurance view does not add anything significant to the epistemic evaluation of group testimony.
- no other theory can properly explain how trust or trustworthiness impacts testimony-based belief in a justified and significant way
- thus, if we evaluate group testimony by means of reliance rather than trust, we do not loose much (or anything) that is epistemically significant
- there might be moral or psychological factors that are relevant though

reactive attitudes

if members help to ensure the reliability of a groups statements

"Nevertheless, there are two related reactions which can be appropriate, even without group trustworthiness or untrustworthiness. First: individual people are liable to praise and blame, and to gratitude and resentment, for their personal trustworthiness and untrustworthiness in helping to generate group statements. Second: it is appropriate to react positively (negatively) to living in a society in which important groups and institutions are reliable (unreliable) producers of true statements." (p. 16)

"On this picture, a group statement is like a reading provided by a complex machine: we can hold the designers, operators, and maintainers responsible for ensuring that the machine provides accurate readings, without regarding any individual as asserting the content of the reading." (p.16f)

"So reactive attitudes connected to ‘trusting’ a group can sensibly be directed at individuals connected to the group. But is this really feasible where the audience does not know who these individuals are? Yes" (p. 17)

Questions for the Project Tutorial 02.02.23

1. Warum hilft uns der Assurance view nicht oder nur begrenzt weiter, wenn wir group testimony  auf seine Glaubwürdigkeit evaluieren wollen? (S. 11 und 12)
	1. Wer übernimmt im Fall von group testimony die Verantwortung (im Sinne des assurance views?)
2. Warum scheint es Hawley nicht besonders sinnstiftend, group testimony mit Hilfe von trustworthiness zu evaluieren? (S. 18 und 20)
3. Was ist mit group actions? (dazu habe ich selbst keine Ahnung?) (S. 18f.)
4. In welchem Zusammenhang stehen reactive attitudes und group testimony, insbesondere, wenn Gruppenmitglieder dabei helfen, die Verlässlichkeit der testimony zu garantieren? (S. 16f.)
