## Notes

> [! abstract] Overview
> This paper is an opinionated literature review on the topic of general social [[undefined/trust|trust]]. It understands general social trust as referring to two forms of trust: 
> - General trust in individuals. [[undefined/horizontal-vs-vertical-trust|Horizontal]] trust in the generalized other (i.e. also in unknown people). Could be [[undefined/one-place-trust|One-Place Trust]] or [[undefined/two-place-trust|Two-Place Trust]]. Maybe similar to [[undefined/generalized-trust|Generalized Trust]].
> 	- Benefits: "has been associated with economic growth due to reduced transaction and monitoring costs, as well as with increased cooperation and various forms of collective action" (p. 446)
> - General trust in institutions. [[undefined/horizontal-vs-vertical-trust|Vertical]].
> 	- Benefits: "is central to the production of cooperation, social cohesion, and social order in society" (p. 447)
> 
> The paper also reviews what could undermine social trust:
> - It claims that, while (ethnic) diversity has been mentioned as detrimental, it is only detrimental in specific circumstances.
> 	- note: often not isolated ethnic diversity -- but: socio-economic class etc.
> - "[Socio-economic] inequality appears to undermine general trust in individuals more than any other factor" (p. 447)
> - "Corruption exerts a similarly detrimental effect on general trust in institutions" (p. 447)
>
> Moreover, inequality, decrease in trust and corruption might actually form a viscious circle (coined the *inequality trap* by Uslaner 2002).

- Similar topic to [[undefined/culture-of-trust-sztompka-1998-|Culture of Trust, Sztompka (1998)]]
- note that trust is central to market exchange
- paper doesn't discuss positive trust feedback loops (how efficient institutions generate trust)
