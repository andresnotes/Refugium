This note defines the <mark style="background: #BE822366;">use case</mark> of this page. It further clarifies what this page is *not*.
## 1. Use Case of this Page
- <mark style="background: #BE822366;">Store Literature Notes: </mark> The vault/page stores literature notes on selected topics, mainly in philosophy and economics. This includes the original papers in pdf format. Ideally, this means, I do not have to read papers again entirely as the literature note sufficiently summarises key ideas and findings. Literature notes are a specific category of notes.
- <mark style="background: #BE822366;">Connect Pieces of Information and Make them Accessible:</mark> One main perk of digital and decentralised note taking is the ability to link between notes and avoid artificial hierarchies. A second perk is how searchable and accessible all information is through powerful search tools and due to the fact that it is not spread throughout several note books, folders and apps.
- <mark style="background: #BE822366;">Develop Own Thoughts:</mark> By developing own thoughts going beyond and resulting from the literature notes and files stored here, I can develop original thoughts in a separate, specific category of notes.
- <mark style="background: #BE822366;">Framework for Writing and Thinking:</mark> Actively expanding this page can assist in a structured approach to literature research, thinking and writing. It can thus be a companion for productive academic work. It can further help me retain information on topics I find interesting and care to include, as my memory is patchy at times.

## 2. What this Page is not.
- <mark style="background: #BE822366;">A Storage for Common Concepts:</mark> The page is not a recreation of Wikipedia. The aim is not to provide lengthy notes about common[^1] concepts and terms. One reason is to make the workload of this page manageable, a second one is to limit myself from attempting to endlessly link to other notes or to take hours writing notes about topics that are perfectly well explained on the internet. A summary of a collection of related common concepts might however be a useful note, if it promises to safe the time of looking up all these concepts individually in the future (e.g. Mathematical Moments)
- <mark style="background: #BE822366;">A Comprehensive Collection of Information on ANY Topic:</mark> Having this as a goal can lead to frustration quickly as it is not achievable. One person cannot match the dedication, brain power and time investment of all the nerds on the internet.

[^1]: 	This includes concepts common to the subjects I discuss (i.e. Philosophy and Economics). If necessary, I link to external sources explaining key concepts and terms.
