**Refugium** | rɪˈfjuːdʒɪəm | noun

sicherer Ort, an dem jemand seine Zuflucht findet, an den er sich zurückziehen kann, um ungestört zu sein; Zufluchtsort.

*A safe place where someone finds refuge, to which they can retreat to be undisturbed; a place of refuge.*

I use the word particularly in its German meaning, unrestricted by its English connotation. I chose is solely for the reason that I like the idea of collecting thoughts (my own and those of others) on some of  my own academic topics of interests in this place, where they can persist beyond my feeble memory or the chaos of the rest of the internet.

The following defines the <mark style="background: #BE822366;">use  case</mark> of this page. It further clarifies what this page is *not*.
## 1. Use Case of this Page
1. <mark style="background: #BE822366;">Develop Own Thoughts:</mark>  The ultimate goal of this knowledge Refugium is to develop original thoughts resulting from and going beyond what others have previously thought. The core idea is that originality emerges from creating, publicly curating and interacting with the notes on the ideas and findings of other people (i.e. literature and lecture notes) and to capture this originality in its own category of notes.
2. <mark style="background: #BE822366;">Thinking in Public and Embracing Imperfection:</mark> Making my work and thoughts publicly available forces me to be more clear and comprehensible. I know from personal experience that putting myself under this kind of "pressure" helps me engage more actively with the material I work with. As this bears the risk of sinking unreasonable amounts of time into the notes – which is by no means my goal – it further incentivises me to embrace their imperfection. My thoughts are usually neither ground breaking nor the most eloquent but for that reason not without value for myself or others.
3. <mark style="background: #BE822366;">Framework for Writing and Thinking:</mark> Actively expanding the Refugium can assist in a structured approach to literature research, thinking and writing. It can thus be a companion for productive academic work. It can further help me retain information on topics I find interesting and care to include, as my memory is patchier than I would like.
4. <mark style="background: #BE822366;">Connect Pieces of Information and Make them Accessible:</mark> One main perk of digital and decentralised note taking is the ability to link between notes, avoid artificial hierarchies and connect seemingly unrelated ideas. A second perk is how searchable and accessible all information is through powerful search tools and due to the fact that it is not spread throughout several note books, folders and apps.
5. <mark style="background: #BE822366;">Store Notes about Other's Knowledge (Literature and Lecture Notes): </mark> The Refugium stores literature and lecture notes on selected topics, mainly in philosophy and economics. This includes a permanent link to the original papers if possible. Ideally, I do not have to read papers again entirely as the literature note sufficiently summarises key ideas and findings, creating a specific category of notes that serve as the foundation for original thought.

## 2. What this Page is not.
- <mark style="background: #BE822366;">A Storage for Common Concepts:</mark> The page is not a recreation of Wikipedia. The aim is not to provide lengthy notes about common[^1] concepts and terms. One reason is to make the workload of this page manageable, a second one is to limit myself from attempting to endlessly link to other notes or to take hours writing notes about topics that are perfectly well explained on the internet. A summary of a collection of related common concepts might however be a useful note, if it promises to safe the time of looking up all these concepts individually in the future (e.g. Mathematical Moments)
- <mark style="background: #BE822366;">A Comprehensive Collection of Information on ANY Topic:</mark> Having this as a goal can lead to frustration quickly as it is not achievable. One person cannot match the dedication, brain power and time investment of all the nerds on the internet.

[^1]: 	This includes concepts common to the subjects I discuss (i.e. Philosophy and Economics). If necessary, I link to external sources explaining key concepts and terms.
